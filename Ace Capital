Project Overview 
Overview
Ace Capital: Transparent On-Chain Hedge Fund
Ace Capital is an on-chain hedge fund built on Avalanche, merging futures trading with web3 transparency. Its passthrough smart contract transfers assets (AVAX, USDC) to Binance/Bybit, logs trades via APIs, retrieves profits after a 6-month lockup, and enables withdrawals. Our 4-month MVP achieved 100%+ return (1% risk, 10:1 R:R). We request $12k for a Certik audit to launch securely by June 2025, targeting $10M+ AUM from Dubai’s $996B wealth pool. Open-sourced post-audit, it’s adaptable to Polkadot/Kusama via Moonbeam, enhancing cross-chain DeFi. Our team is driven to pioneer transparent trading.
Project Details
Mockups: None yet—UI development pending audit.  

API Specs: Logs trades {trade_id, timestamp, amount, result} via REST APIs—repo README details.  

Tech Stack: Solidity (Avalanche EVM), ReactJS (future UI), Rust (Polkadot bridge potential), Certik.  

Documentation: Inline comments + Avalanche testnet deployment tutorial.  

PoC: 4-month MVP on Binance/Bybit—100%+ return, pre-Avalanche deployment.  

Not Included: Tokenomics, hosting, marketing—focus is audit and launch.

Ecosystem Fit
Fit: Bridges Avalanche’s trading yield to Polkadot/Kusama via Moonbeam, boosting cross-chain DeFi.  

Audience: DeFi devs, traders, HNWIs seeking auditable returns.  

Needs: Meets demand for transparent, high-yield trading in DeFi.  

Evidence: Forum (forum.avax.network, “Transparency Needs,” Jan 2025), X (@DeFiYields
, Feb 2025).  

Similar Projects: None on Polkadot/Kusama match our 10:1 R:R + logs. Aave (lending) differs—Ace targets futures.  

Related Ecosystems: Ethereum’s gas costs block our yield model—unique to Avalanche.
